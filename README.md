# Heap Visualization

An interactive Flutter application that visualizes heap data structure operations. This tool helps in understanding how heaps work by providing a visual representation of the heap structure and step-by-step visualization of various operations.

## Features

- Visual representation of Min and Max Heaps with an interactive diagram
- Interactive insertion and removal of elements
- Step-by-step visualization of heap operations
- Toggle between Min Heap and Max Heap
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Visual Example
